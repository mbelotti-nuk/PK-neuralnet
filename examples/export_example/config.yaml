# 'savepknn' permits to export the neural newtork saved a '.pt' model to a '.dat' format 
# which can be read by NACARTE and used in SpaceClaim

# Path in which the '.dat' model is saved
save_path: ""
# Name of the '.dat' file
save_name: "PKDNN"


# Path to the '.pt' neural network model
path_to_model: \Users\mario\OneDrive\Desktop\UNED\Phd\PointKernelMethod\PKnn\examples\model_example\NNmodel.pt

# DNN architecture
# a list that gives to each layer the corresponing number of neurons
# note that f_maps[0] has to be equal to the number of inputs
